#TIC-TAC-TOE React App (*Coder Notes*)
This are the notes, which, as I wrote down, helped me to get a grasp of what was going on at every click, or function call.
Understand the flow click by click, function by function, line by line...

#### Line :three::one:
```js
 handleClick(i){
      const squares=this.state.squares.slice()
      squares[i]='X'
      this.setState({squares:squares})
      //console.table(squares)
       /* ^ enable the clg to se 
      how the state is set by the square's 
      index on the square array (Board's State)*/
    }

```
Setting **"X"** to the state ***"squares"*** which defined as an array *(in Board parent component)* and indicating its' index to which the value will be set. This value is sent by the **renderSquare( i )** function in every square element that is rendered *(as Board reders on the React App)*. 
This way, every time the state ***squares*** in Board updates, the component Square within re-renders with the updated state. Square is a **controlled component**, Board has full controll over them.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
